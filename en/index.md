Do not change people.  
Do not manipulate the field.  
Still, **preserve the structure that allows us to remain where we are, with room to choose.**

## What HAS Is

HAS is not a method for creating change.  
It is a minimal design that allows what already exists  
**to remain open, not closed by fear.**

- It does not promise outcomes  
- It does not present correct answers  
- It does not instruct actions  

HAS preserves the state in which,  
before deciding or acting,  
**options are not closed off.**

## What It Preserves

- Agency (the freedom to choose or not choose)  
- Safety (not being intruded upon)  
- Self-generation (answers are not imposed from outside)  
- Non-separation in relationships (remaining connected with others)  

---

## Who It Is Not For

- Those seeking immediate results  
- Those who want to move or control others  
- Those who want the right answer  
- Those who want guaranteed outcomes
