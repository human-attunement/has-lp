# Human Attunement System (HAS)

Do not change people.  
Do not manipulate the field.  
Still, remain without breaking.

---

## What HAS is

HAS is not a method to create change.  
It is a minimal structure to prevent what already exists from being broken by fear.

- No promise of results  
- No correct answers  
- No instructions for action  

---

## What it protects

- Agency (the freedom to choose or not)
- Safety (not being intruded upon)
- Self-emergence (no answers given from outside)
- Non-separation in relationships

---

## Not for those who want

- Immediate results
- To move or fix others
- Clear answers
- Guaranteed outcomes

---
